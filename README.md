## Introduction
  In the midst of pandemic, it is very dangerous to roam around outside. However, this cannot be prevented since most people go outside to buy necessary items and at times like this people also want to gain information about the current situation of the problem that the humanity is facing today. 

  Therefore, we have come up with an idea to create an application where the people doesnâ€™t need to step outside their house in order to buy the essentials.

  Essentials Hub is an application that allows the user to meet their needs in terms of crisis like this. This application can also be reliable in terms of viewing helpful information that allows the user to view statistics and graphs that are useful for them to be aware about the present circumstances. This does not only help the people to become aware of the current situation, but also helping them prevent the spread of the virus by making them stay at home without having to think about how they are going to buy their needs.


## Objectives

The objectives of the project are the following:
- To create an online shopping program specified for calamities.
- To collect info regarding COVID-19 cases and their localities in the Philippines.
- To visualize the gathered information into appropriate graphs.
- To create an Artificial Intelligence for convenience in terms of query.
- To develop a blog section for a direct communication between the client and administrator.
